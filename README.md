# LOBOS-UNM-Womens-Golf-Team-App
app uses a FULL STACK and a database to create a golf team performance management application for the LOBOS UNM Womenâ€™s golf team. This app will enable myself and my team to have up to date access to each others statistics and performance progress and update any results as they occur.  The data will include team members basic information, with their yearly golf performance statistics.   The front end will show the team members and their recorded statistics with additional links to UNM golf data and information.  I may also show any upcoming events.
